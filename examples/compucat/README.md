# COMPUCAT

Say hi to COMPUCAT! 

Remember Tamagochi from your childhood? Miss it? Don't be sad! COMPUCAT IS HERE!

COMPUCAT likes to be near you. Leave COMPUCAT out in the cold, and COMPUCAT will request a hug.

COMPUCAT is also a light sensitive little creature. Too much light hurts COMPUCAT'S sensors, and darkness may confuse COMPUCAT and make COMPUCAT think it is night, even when it is not. 

Be careful with moving around COMPUCAT. COMPUCAT likes a rocket ride, but not for long. COMPUCAT easily gets scared and nauseous, and might throw up. COMPUCAT might even DIE! :( 

Now, leave COMPUCAT and let COMPUCAT get some sleep. Zzz.
